# 🛍️ E-Commerce Frontend (Angular)

This is the frontend for the E-Commerce application built using **Angular**. It consumes a RESTful API (created in Spring Boot) to allow users to browse products, register, log in and manage their cart.

This is my **first Angular project**, and it's part of a complete full-stack e-commerce system.
